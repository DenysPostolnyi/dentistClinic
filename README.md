# Final Project
Web application for dentist clinic. 
### Task: 
Dentist clinic wants to introduce a digital appointment to doctors. I need to develop a web application for them. Administrator should be able to register clients and appoint them to doctor therapist. In turn, the therapist should be able reassign patient to another doctor.
### Entity: 
    • Patient (fields: full name, year of birthday, kind of ache (none, little, middle, strong), time of appointment);
    • Doctor (fields: full name, seniority, specialty (therapist, orthopedist, surgeon, radiologist), amount of assigned pacients);
Relationship between entities: one to many (patient can be registered only to one doctor, but doctor can have many patients).
